# Essential_books
This repository contains books from different topics and perfect enough to give developers a boost in understanding the concepts of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence(other topics are also included but main highlights are these two).

# Contributor Code of Conduct
### Guidelines
- make sure a book is free. Double-check if needed. It helps the admins if you comment in the PR as to why you think the book is free.
- we don't accept files hosted on google drive, dropbox, mega, scribd, issuu and other similar file upload platforms
- insert your links in alphabetical order. If you see a misplaced link, please reorder it and submit a PR
- use the link with the most authoritative source (meaning author's website is better than editor's website is better than third party website)
    + no file hosting services (this includes (but is not limited to) Dropbox and Google Drive links)
- always prefer a `https` link over a `http` one -- as long as they are on the same domain and serve the same content
- on root domains, strip the trailing slash: `http://example.com` instead of `http://example.com/`
- always prefer the shortest link: `http://example.com/dir/` is better than `http://example.com/dir/index.html`
    + no URL shortener links
- usually prefer the "current" link over the "version" one: `http://example.com/dir/book/current/` is better than `http://example.com/dir/book/v1.0.0/index.html`
- if a link has an expired certificate/self-signed certificate/SSL issue of any other kind:
  1. *replace it* with its `http` counterpart if possible (because accepting exceptions can be complicated on mobile devices)
  2. *leave it* if no `http` version but link still accessible through `https` by adding an exception to the browser or ignoring the warning
  3. *remove it* otherwise
- if a link exists in multiple format, add a separate link with a note about each format
- if a resource exists at different places on the Internet
    + use the link with the most authoritative source (meaning author's website is better than editor's website is better than third party website)
    + if they link to different editions and you judge these editions are different enough to be worth keeping them, add a separate link with a note about each edition 
- prefer atomic commits (one commit by addition/deletion/modification) over bigger commits. No need to squash your commits before submitting a PR. (We will never enforce this rule as it's just a matter of convenience for the maintainers)
- if the book is older, include the publication date with the title. 
- include the author name or names where appropriate. You can shorten author lists with "et al."
- if the book is not finished, and is still being worked on, add the "in process" notation.
